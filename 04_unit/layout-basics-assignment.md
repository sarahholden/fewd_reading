# Layout Basics Assignment

Now that we've learned about layout, we're even better equipped to format our HTML and uniquely style our memory game!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

The current state of your game could use some formatting and personalization.
* To give your webpage a nice personal touch, add a footer with some personalized text. Perhaps something like: `Created with love by <your name>`.
* Figure out a way to throw in an icon as well, and make your name a different color than the rest of the text to give it some oomph.
* Last but not least, give your site a nice touch by centering all of its text.

##### Below are the steps to complete the assignment:

1) Create your footer with the given text and a heart icon underneath your `div`s, before your closing `body` tag:

*Created with &hearts; by GA*

2) Wrap the words "GA" using `span` tags and it give it a class of "name" so you can style it.

3) Go into `style.css` and color your name with `#ff0000`.

4) Finally, center the text in the `body` selector using the `text-align` property.


#### Deliverable

Nice â€” things are looking better already!
