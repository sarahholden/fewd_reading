# Layout Basics Cheat Sheet

#### Span
* A generic wrapper for any inline content. `span`s are generally used to group small sections of content for styling purposes.

#### Div
* A generic wrapper for any block content. `div`s are used to group other elements together or to provide style to a specific area.

#### Header
* These elements kick off your page with introductory content like logos, headlines, titles, and links.

#### Footer
* This element wraps the content at the bottom of your web page. This element often contains copyright information, links to career pages, contact information, terms of use, etc.

#### Main
* These elements contain all the primary content — articles, blog posts, images, videos, etc. — between the `<header>` and the `<footer>`.

#### Aside
* These elements contain all the secondary content between the `<header>` and `<footer>`, including supplemental information like recommended stories or archived blog links.

#### Nav
* Any navigational links that help users get around your page should be wrapped in `<nav>` tags.

#### Section
* These elements are used to group the content of a page into related chunks.

#### Article
* These elements are used to contain standalone blocks of text, such as news articles, blog posts, etc.

#### Box Model
* Every HTML element on the page is in a box, and the box model dictates what the element will look like. The model consists of the content, padding, border, and margin.

Here's a diagram to help you remember the box model.

#### Content
* The text and images that are included within any element's opening and closing tags.

#### Padding
* The area outside the content, but within the `border`. `padding` will extend the `background-color` and contribute to the overall `width` of the object.

#### Border
* A line of variable thickness, color, and style that goes around the `padding` and content.

#### Margin
* The area outside of the `border` that separates the object from other objects around it. `margin` has a transparent `background-color`.

#### Inline Elements
* HTML elements that take up the width of their contents and do not begin with new line. They cannot have `height` or `width` assigned.

#### Block Elements
* HTML elements that break to a new line before and after the element and they take up the width of their containers by default (this is often the browser window itself). They can have `padding`, `margin`, `height`, and `width` assigned.

#### Span
* Inline and used to apply CSS to inline HTML.

#### Div
* A `block` element used to apply CSS to blocks of HTML. Divs typically wrap big sections of content on a page. Use semantic elements over divs whenever possible.
