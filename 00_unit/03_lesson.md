### JS Bin Exercises

Fundamentals is interactive! Within every Unit, we've included practice exercises using a code editor (called JS Bin) that allows you to practice without leaving the page.

Here's an example. You can type your code directly into the text editor and also click the various tabs (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT) to type in additional code. The OUTPUT tab will render your code in real time.

Click on the tabs to get used to the navigation.

#### To Save Your Code

Creating a free account on JS Bin will allow you to save your exercises as "bins." So make sure to create a [JS Bin account](https://jsbin.com/login). Follow the instructions below to create your JS Bin account and learn how to save your code.

1)  If you want to save your code, you'll need to hit the "SAVE" button on the top left of the JS Bin editor, which will open a new browser.

2) Log in using a GitHub account. If you don’t have one go [here](../07_chapter/07_exercise.html) to find instructions set up your account. *As of recently, JS bin only accepts GitHub accounts for registration.*

3) Once logged in, if you try to make your changes in any tab, you’ll receive the following message.

You’ll want to click on the “clone your own copy” which will generate a new link.

4) Now that you're logged in, you can save your code by doing one of the following:

* `File` > `Export` as gist.
	* This will save your file as a github repository on your github! Read more about gists [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/)
* `File` > `Download`. 
	* Download and save your file locally.
* Save your JS bin url. 
	* Simply copy and save your JS bin url for future reference. You can also go to File >My Bins to find the bin. Additionally, you can also `File` > `Save Snapshot` at point in time where JS bin will automatically save the latest version for you on your working copy.

**Pro Tip**: Remember, the code you write in the JS Bin editor will *not automatically save.* Therefore, you need to make sure that you hit the ***save*** button and make sure you copy your code over.

**Note**: If your JS Bin editor doesn't load or shows `JS Bin on jsbin.com`, simply refresh the page to load the page again.
