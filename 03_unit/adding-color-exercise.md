Let's practice matching colors across the three web color models: named colors, hex codes, and RGB colors.

### Instructions
If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

#### HTML: Starter Code

Let's begin with the starter code below. The `DOCTYPE`, `HTML`, `head`, `link`, and `body` elements should be familiar to you from the previous unit. `div`s and IDs are new HTML concepts for you. The value of the ID attribute is the name of that div. For now, just remember that "div element" is just a tool to group content into boxes that you can control and style with CSS. The attribute ID lets you name an HTML element to style it differently than other elements of that type.

#### CSS: Starter Code
Let's look at the starter CSS. This div style sets the size, position, style, and whitespace on all three boxes.

>**Note** **Named colors** refer to names like "black" and "white". Compared to hex codes and RGB colors, there is a pretty limited number of named colors.

1) Change the value of the `#name` `div` from `white` to `red`. Remember to click on the **Output** button to see what your code now renders!

2) Turn the `#hex` `div` red by leaving the first two characters at their maximums of `ff`, and changing the last four characters to their minimums of `0`.

3) Turn the `#rgb` `div` red by leaving the red value at its maximum of `255`, and changing both the green and blue values to their minimums of `0`.

4) What color do you think you'd get if you set all the RGB values to their minimum of `0`? Can you set all three boxes to that color?
  * Go ahead and set all the numbers in the RGB color model to `0.`
  * Set all six characters in the `#hex` `div` to `0`.
  * Then, use a named color to make all three boxes the same color.

**Bonus**:

Now, let's work with the alpha value in the RGB model using the following `#rgb` style:

```css
#rgb {
  background: rgba(0,0,0,1);
}
```

The default opacity is already 100%, so you won't see any change on screen yet. But now you have a means to set the opacity.

Now try changing the alpha value (the last value in `rgba`) to `.5` (50% opacity). Then, try `.8` or `.2` to see the difference between each value.

*Bravo to you for mastering color models for the web. Take this knowledge forward and make the internet a more colorful space!*
