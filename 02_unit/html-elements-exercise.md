> **NOTE** Moving forward we'll be labeling HTML tags and relevant code in the `following format`. e.g., `p` for a paragraph tag or element.

##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Time to give it a go! In this exercise, you'll get some practice opening and closing your first HTML tags.

Your output should look like this:

### Instructions

Type your answers directly into the JS Bin text editor below. If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

1) Let's start with some content! Type the text below into your editor. Your content will render live in the **Output** window.

```
My first website!
by a talented student
Built at GA.
```

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/rewadi/embed?html,css,output">My First Website on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.40.3"></script>

2) Next, open a *level one heading tag* (`h1`) at the very beginning where it says, "My first website!"

3) Did you notice that all the content was set to `h1`? Aha! That's because you still need to close the tag, which tells the browser when to stop rendering the text as a heading. Go ahead and close the heading tag now.

4) Open and close *level two heading tag* (`h2`) on the second line that says, "by a talented student."

5) Lastly, wrap this sentence in a *paragraph tag* (`p`): "Built at GA."



Sweet! You just built a website with HTML. Sure, it's pretty basic right now, but you're just getting started.

#### Checkpoint

Make sure you have:
- Opened and closed `h1` tags around the site's name.
- Opened and closed `h2` tags around the site's subheading.
- Opened and closed `p` tags around the site's body content.
